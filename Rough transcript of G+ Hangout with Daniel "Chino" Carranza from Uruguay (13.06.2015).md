Daniel:

(http://atuservicio.uy/) is a product of an agreement between Ministry of Health in Uruguay and a civil society organisation DATA Uruguay (http://datauy.org/).

DATA Uruguay used some of the information the Ministry of Health was already publishing, helping to get this (information) out in more usable way and also helping them to publish this data as an open data, properly. Because all they had before were excell sheets, which were neither useful, nor machine readable. (http://atuservicio.uy/) is the result [of this collaboration]

(http://atuservicio.uy/) shows very general view of the data available on health providers. There is data on every single health provider in Uruguay, both private and public. There is information from the whole system.

(http://atuservicio.uy/) categories [from left to right]:

* general information
* waiting times by different category
* user rights (including satisfaction)
* prices of tickets and orders (by medication, consultation, urgent consultation, life studies (??))
* goals Ministry sets to the providers (comes from goals set by Ministry for health providers showing how much they accomplished: 1) references, 2) pregnancies, 3) children under 1 y.o.)
* amount of affiliates
* human resources (pediatricians, gynecologists, nurses,temporary nurses)

On the main page is a grouped view of the data of healthcare providers.

(http://atuservicio.uy/) - top-down

* different providers
* how many clinics they have

You can choose place where you leave. You can choose an institution and compare data from up to 3 health providers:  (http://atuservicio.uy/comparar/?selected_providers=90005%206012%209508). On the bottom (Sedes) drop downs list all services provided by each clinic.

(http://datauy.org/) created (http://atuservicio.uy/) because every February in Uruguay people are able to change health provider. Minister was very keen **to help people to make the best possible choice based on information, but not only on marketing**. People don't have much to go about beyond what they can see on TV or read in news papers. This is the first time people get very deep and trustworthy information on their health providers.

+ Q: How often they Health Provides have to submit their data?
+ Daniel: Right now once a year. Twice a year in the future. We haven't done 'twice' yet. 'We'= http://datauy.org/ + the Ministry of Health in Uruguay.

There was a change in government. Election took place last year. The actual change took place in March. So we are a bit late, but managed to update information before the end of the year and then once again in February.

+ Q: How do you validate this information? For example, I did a procedure, but they charged me twice...

+ Daniel: Not yet, but it's part of the plan. (http://datauy.org/) agreed with the Ministry to have 3 stages. 1) To show information they already have and show it in the better way. DONE.; 2) Like a book, which will show much broader information on health in general in Uruguay (like epidemiologic information, vaccines...); 3) Have feedback from users. Not only if information true or false, we have already this through 'user voice' and was fed directly to a ministry which had already interesting talks with some health providers. This comes next February.

+ Q: Is there information how many people changed health providers?

+ Daniel: This information is published. We don't show it over here in part because our focus is not on people changing or not but having the right information. They can do whatever they want. They have an annual report. I can send it to you. The system is very stable. Usually people go from one provider to another but general results remain the same. Around 64,000 people changed health provide last year, that very stable.

+ Q: How did http://datauy.org/ creates a coalition with the Ministry of Health
+ Daniel: The whole thing started because they were already publishing the data. They were just publishing it in very unfriendly way, but with the best intentions in mind. So we started in 2014.. We were working on this from 2014 with some data portal to do with data journalism... They took this data and created the first version of the app making a joke of what people can do in February and transfer sison in football. They very much liked that someone was using their data, helping them to get people to see this data. After this they had some discussion table in Uruguay around the OGP process. That was an opportunity to meet with the Health Ministry and to talk with them, thinking about what we can do together. By November 2014 we had an agreement signed and started walking on this project. Right now we are walking on renewal of the agreement so we keep working till 2020.

+ Q: The process is collaborative, like a joint venture?
+ Daniel: That's the most interesting part. From the very beginning we've been working with the ministry. It's not that we had a preconceived idea or they had an idea and asked us to do it. We sat and we said, hey, what should we do we change completely we show the data from the previous app. They were explaining the best way data can be shown. We both invested money in this. The ministry spend $12,000 and we got from Avina Foundation another $12,000. In this sense it's completely co-created. It's not like owned by one of us. It's also hosted on our servers. So they don't have final control what we publish. It's really based on trust. Luckily we were not only able to keep our trust, but to keep working on and advancing in this sense.

+ Q: If there interest from Ministry of Health to publish more data after success of this venture?
+ Daniel: yes, definitely. What they've been doing is publishing this data for the last 4 years. And every year they publish new data. That's on them, has nothing to do with us. That's something they already been doing. What we insisted that this data is published properly as open data, and definitely the plan to keep adding more data. But the thing is we don't have an advantage of mature data management skills within the Ministry.

The last 10 years were pretty good for Uruguay. Before that we had very long period of not very good times. So the public sector really feels this. They are working with very outdated technology in some places. They are working hard to update this but it's hard work.

We don't have an ease that all data is properly managed, it's there and a ready for publishing. Beyond political decision to publish this data sometimes we have a problem just to gather this data or know who has it or if it's comparable. So, in this sense we work in parallel within  the Ministry (they working to update the system, upgrade the skills set) and also while this work progresses to share it with everybody around.

+ Q. What's and update on use? How many users used this data?
+ Daniel: We had 34,000 users for the app. That was in February, becos that's the period when people are interested in this data. To put it in the context, Uruguay has 3.4 million people, so that's around 1% of population. Around 1.5 million were able to change provider in February, cos you have to be with your 1st provider for at least 3 years (note: from the moment you got the job). So about 2% of those who were able to change provider used this app and 64,000 people actually changed providers. That's around 50% of people who changed health provider. Of course we don't believe that everyone was part of this group. Just to give you some numbers to compare to.

+ Q. Is the government using the data to improve processes they provide?
+ Daniel: We don't have proper feedback since this was implemented. But definitely we had very interesting consequences from publishing this data.

The data was published in excel sheets  in the last 4 years. the best number of downloads was 500. The increase of exposure was around 7,000%.

So what happened, nobody really cared about this information before. I'm talking about Health providers. Because nobody was seeing this. So there were these who were sending no data, data was outdated or just plane wrong. This year, because the publication had a lot of feedback from the press, we started getting calls and emails on the very 1st day saying "oh, we just realised the data is outdated, sorry. We really must correct this. Those prices are lower." And they were desperate calling the Ministry and calling us and correcting us and they really couldn't care less in the last 4 years.

One health provider send data to the Ministry through sworn declaration (??), when you need to get a lawyer and a notarius involved. Usually it takes a month to do it. One of them got it in 2 days, because he was so desperate to update their prices. That was a lot of fun.

As soon as information was published, the political system started discussion on the quality of healthcare, for the 1st time based on data, not on opinion.

We had politicians talking about http://atuservicio.uy/; we had doctors union talking about it; the health care providers talking about the app itself

+ Q. So there is a legal obligation on the part of service providers to give their data to the Ministry?
+ Daniel: Yes, but with little caveat. It's obligatory for the group which gets some money from the system which deducted from salaries. For the private insurance - they are not obliged to share this information.

[Daniel shares his screen] Most of Seguro Privado (private insurance) - some data they don't have. But they have to share the data about their waiting times. But since the data was published, they are very interested in showing it. They didn't care before, but now they do.

Greater transparency of the whole system will force them for practical reasons to share their data.

Thank you. We are open for collaborations and love working with other countries.
